This repo contains all the knowledge and experience I have gained from working on Data Structures and Algorithms using C and C++<br>
<br>
Question 1: What will be covered in this course?<br>
Topics covered in this course
- Arrays
- Matrices
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queues
- Trees
- Graph
- Hashing
- Recursion
- Sortings
<br>
Question 2: What are data structures?<br>
A program is a set of instructions which perform operations on data.<br>
Without data, instructions cannot be performed => Data is an important part of a program.<br>
When a program is dealing with the data, how it will organize the data in the main memory, that is what its data structure is, the way you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of 
a program that is data structure.<br>
<br>
The arrangement of data so that the data can be best utilized, most efficiently utilized, by the program is called data structure.<br>
Depending on the requirements of the program, the type of procedures it is performing, we have various data structures.<br>
Depending on your requirements, you can choose a suitable data structure.<br>
<br>
Different types of data structures<br>
- Physical: How the data is arranged in the memory<br>
&nbsp; * Arrays<br>
&nbsp; * Matrices<br>
&nbsp; * Linked List<br>
- Logical: How the data can be utilized, how the arrangement is and how it should be utilized<br>
&nbsp; * Stack<br>
&nbsp; * Queues<br>
&nbsp; * Trees<br>
&nbsp; * Graph<br>
&nbsp; * Hashing<br>
<br>
Question 3: Why study data structures?<br>
  - First, data structure is the core subject for programmers or I.T. profession and for any under/graduates who are pursuing the engineering goals.<br>
  - Second, if you are working as a programmers then you have to use data structures in your application development. Without data structures, you cannot develop application at all.<br>
<br>
Question 4: At what level you should study data structures?<br>
  - Level 1 (Basic): You do programming and you know what the data structures are and you study how they work and where to use them (regardless of whether or not you are a computer science 
graduates).<br>
  - Level 2: You know the internal details of the data structures and you can analyze them based on the time and the space complexities. You understand in depth the operations that are performed by 
them AND you know how those operations are performed.<br>
  - Level 3: You are experienced with the data structures in depth and you can code them and now you can develop your own data structure. You can program them by yourself.<br>
<br>
Question 5: What level of data structures will be covered in this course?<br>
This course will cover up to the Level 3 of knowledge and details for the data structures which means<br>
  - You will know how the data structures work.<br>
  - You know the internal details.<br>
  - You will be able to do analysis and in-depth analysis.<br>
  - You will be able to program the data structures from scratch.<br>
<br>
Question 6: Which programming language is suitable for data structures?<br>
Whichever language you know.<br>
<br>
Question 7: Do you have to develop these data structures in every programming language you know?<br>
No. You don't have to develop your own data structures yet you have to use the already existing data structures and you should know how they work and where to use them.<br>
<br>
Most languages already provide a built-in data structures, most people studying the languages want to know how to use the built-in data structures for those languages and that should be sufficient 
enough.<br>
However, the C language does NOT have any built-in data structures so you will HAVE TO develop your OWN code.<br>
<br>
Question 8: Which language will be used in this course?<br>
C and C++<br>
<br>
Question 9: Why the C language for this course?<br>
C is the most suitable language for doing programming on the data structures.<br>
WHY??<br>
  - The similarity and compatibility between C and other languages. E.g. syntax, global variables,...<br>
  - C does NOT already has its data structures so you will learn to write them by yourself, other languages already have their built-in data structures so there is no need for you to program them.<br>
<br>
Question 10: Why learning recursion?<br>
  - Recursion is a difficult topic for the students.<br>
  - Most of the operations that are implemented on those data structures are basically defining recursion and they are also implemented without recursion using loops.<br>
  - Even though recursion is usually seen as not useful for solving big problems because it uses stack internally, however, the solution for problem solving comes from mathematics and mathematics have 
recursion.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Programming and problem solving are two completely different things!<br>
Most students often mix them because they think learning programming will teach them problem solving but they are actually different.<br>
Programming can be learned in just a few days BUT problem solving will take a lifetime.<br>
Programming is about the syntax while problem solving requires you to be good at mathematics.<br>
Mathematics does not have loop, mathematics has recursion. Therefore, the solution for problem solving will mostly in the form of recursion.<br>
Every programming language supports recursion, in case if you need to write a recursion then you can write it. Otherwise as a programmer, you can learn how to convert recursion into a loop. So most 
problems are solved in recursion, then they are converted into a loop.<br>
<br>
It is very important that you can understand recursion so then you can understand problem solving.<br>
We have data structures as those listed above, algorithms is a very vast topic. Algorithms is a separate subject.
